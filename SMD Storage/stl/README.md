## Naming Scheme

### Rails
You need to choose a rail and a lid of matching length to close the ballast compartment with.

`rail L'x'mm F'y'mm D'z'.stl`
`lid L'x'mm.stl`

where `x` is the rail length, `y` is foam thickness and `z` is the number of ballast compartments.

### Cassettes
`cassette W'x'mm G'y'mm.stl`

where `x` is the width of the casette and `y` is the height of the tape gap.

#### Alternative naming scheme
`cassette 'z'.stl`

where `z` is a common SMD package, e.g. `0603` meaning that the cassette width and tape gap height are chosen suitably for that package size.
